# Pi Calculator with Matrix Animation

## Project Overview

The **Pi Calculator with Matrix Animation** is a web application that allows users to calculate the value of Pi using a series of iterations while displaying a visually captivating matrix-style background animation. The application is built with HTML, CSS (utilizing Tailwind CSS), and vanilla JavaScript.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pi-calculator.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd pi-calculator
   ```
3. **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

No additional dependencies need to be installed as this project uses only native web technologies and an external CDN for Tailwind CSS.

## Usage

1. Enter the desired number of iterations for the Pi calculation in the input field (between 1 and 1,000,000).
2. Click the **Calculate** button. The app will compute the value of Pi and display it along with the calculation time.
3. If needed, you can click the **Reset** button to clear the input and results.

## Features

- Responsive design that works well on various screen sizes.
- Matrix-style background animation for engaging visuals.
- Real-time calculation of Pi using the Leibniz formula.
- Error handling for invalid input.
- Displays calculation time after processing.

## Dependencies

This project relies on:
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-defined styles readily usable in the application.

No additional JavaScript libraries or frameworks are used.

## Project Structure

Here is an overview of the project's directory structure:

```
/pi-calculator
│
├── index.html         # Main HTML file that contains the UI structure.
├── styles.css         # Custom styles with Tailwind CSS integration.
├── script.js          # JavaScript file containing the logic for animation and Pi calculations.
└── README.md          # Project documentation.
```

### File Descriptions

- **index.html**: The main HTML document containing the layout and structure of the application.
- **styles.css**: Stylesheet for custom styling on top of Tailwind CSS, defining overall aesthetics and animations.
- **script.js**: Contains the logic for the matrix background animation and the Pi calculation process.
